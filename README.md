### LIMINAL ENGINE
Liminal engine is a 3d graphical engine. This project was created as a proof of concept and was partially used in the development of some unfinished games I worked on

## Dependencies
**GLEW:** Glew is used as a wrangler for this project
**GLFW:** Although Window.h provides some functionality and logic related to opening a window, this is mainly handled using GLFW
**stb_image:** Textures are not currently supported, however this library is included to read png image data since this was an important feature in other versions of this engine
While it may be possible to compile this project on other operating systems / platforms, it has only ever been developed on windows and I have not worked to provide support for other platforms

## Main.cpp
This project was intended to be used for other programs and is not useful on its own. To showcase the capabilities of the project, main.cpp implements a **very** simple sandbox program.
A gif of this program running can be found on my website: https://rpovey.com/ (This avoids you having to download the required dependencies and having to figure out how to compile this project yourself)

## Notes / misc
The goal of this project was for it to be written in pure c++. Although some external libraries were used, I feel that since all logic and processing uses c++ this goal is achieved

This project was not developed using git, rather it was finished and then put into a repository. This is mainly because it was built from an old version of the engine with some parts changed and some left the same
This explains the lack of a version history and the overall strange layout of this repo
